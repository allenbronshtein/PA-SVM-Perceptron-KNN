# PA-SVM-Perceptron-KNN

I will implement and compare KNN, Perceptron, SVM, and PA. You are provided

with a training set of 240 examples where i will classify between 3 classes.


Rules for all models:

The dataset is the Iris flower classification. In this dataset, there are five features per
instance (all the features are numerical ) and three labels, which are correspond to the Iris flower
species. 


To run the code:

    python ex2.py <train_x_path> <train_y_path> <test_x_path> <output_path>
